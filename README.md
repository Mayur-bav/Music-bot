What do you gain from it? Let us explain:
 - Completely modular docker environment for easier development and deployment
 - A WORKING DASHBOARD!!!
 - DB Integration for you to save your favorite songs in
 - Integrated self hosted Lavalink
 - Dedicated query channel
 - More commands and functionalities
 - And so much more to come!

## üöß | Prerequisites

- [Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Lavalink Server](https://blog.darrennathanael.com/post/how-to-lavalink/)
  - v5 is currently compatible with Lavalink v3. 
- You'll need to run `npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy`. to initialized the slash commands. _You can do this on your pc
  locally_

> NOTE: Lavalink is needed for music functionality. You need to have a working Lavalink server to make the bot work.

## üìù | Important Note if you're Switching from v4 to v5

1. Download and configure v5 in a seperate folder.
2. Kick your bot out of your server.
3. Reinvite the Bot with the right
   scopes. [Example Invite URL (Change CLIENT_ID)](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&permissions=277083450689&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
4. Run `npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy` to initialize the slash commands. _You can do this on your pc locally_

## üìù | Tutorial

### üê≥ Docker
Update the `docker/application.yml` file with your desired password and port. Change config.js to match your configuration.

Docker is currently using lavalink v3.7.12 as you can see in the `Dockerfile`. If you want to use a different version, you can change the `LAVA_LINK_VERSION` environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file.



You should configure the `config.js` file with the host `"lavalink"`, using the same `password` and `port` as specified in `docker/application.yml`.

Build and start bot and lavalink
```sh
docker-compose up -d --build
```

If you want to view logs for both applications in your console upon running the command, you can remove the `-d` flag.

### üí™üèª Non-Docker
> The `config.js` file should be configured first. Don't forget to add a lavalink host

Create a folder named lavalink and place the lavalink.jar file in it, alongside the application.yml file. Follow [this guide](https://blog.darrennathanael.com/post/how-to-lavalink/) to setup Lavalink. Make sure to use configs for v3 (and to inspect the `docker/application.yml` file to see how the youtube plugin is currently being set.)

Install all dependencies and deploy Slash Commands
```sh
npm install
npm run deploy
```

If you're setting up your own lavalink, initiate it:
```sh
cd lavalink/
java -Xmx2G -jar Lavalink.jar
```

And finally start the bot
```sh
node index.js
```

To run the commands on your server, if everything was done right, upon pressing `/` you should see your bot options. Typing /play <some music> should work. In case you set up your own lavalink/is running docker without the --d flag, you can view your lavalink connections/attempts in the console, aswell as the bot logs.
